# What happens when you type google.com in your browser and press Enter

## Overview
This project aims to explore and explain the underlying infrastructure and technical flow that occurs when a user types `google.com` into a web browser and presses Enter. It provides a deep dive into the network, server interactions, DNS resolution, security protocols, and other components involved in loading a web page.

## Background
As a Full-Stack Software Engineer, understanding the entire technology stack is crucial â€” from frontend to backend, and infrastructure to security. This project helps assess your ability to explain a complex system by breaking down the steps involved in a common user action: accessing a website.

## Objective
- To demonstrate your understanding of the full journey of a web request.
- To write a clear, concise, and technically accurate explanation.
- To practice technical writing skills aimed at both technical and non-technical audiences.

## Requirements
- Write a detailed blog post explaining the process when you type `google.com` and hit Enter.
- Your explanation should cover:
  - DNS lookup
  - TCP/IP connection establishment
  - HTTP/HTTPS protocol and request/response cycle
  - TLS/SSL handshake for secure connections
  - Server processing and response
  - Browser rendering process
- Choose a platform to publish your blog post (LinkedIn, Medium, or any preferred blogging platform).
- Include this `README.md` file at the root of your project folder.
- Manual QA review is required once your project is complete; please request it accordingly.
